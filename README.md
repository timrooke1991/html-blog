# html-blog

This was a simple blog frontend. I built this when I was learning HTML and CSS. It was a useful projects to understand different HTML element, spacing and CSS selectors. 

The uses a Google Font, Sans Source Pro. The aim of this project was simply to try and reflect the simple, but realistic blog layout that you may see on the professional website. Obviously, it does not have the backend functionality to handle and publish posts.
